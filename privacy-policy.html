                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Welcome to THG. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information on our website. Your privacy is important to us.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Language Preference:</strong> To enhance your browsing experience, we use your browser's `localStorage` to remember your selected language (English or Arabic). This information is stored only on your own device and is not sent to us or any server.</li>

                <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>Our website contains links to third-party websites and services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites. When you follow a link to an external site, we encourage you to read their privacy policy.</p>
